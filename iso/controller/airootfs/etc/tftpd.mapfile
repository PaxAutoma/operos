#
# Rule file for the -m (remapping option)
#
# This file has three fields: operation, regex, remapping
#
# The operation is a combination of the following letters:
#
# r - rewrite the matched string with the remapping pattern
# i - case-insensitive matching
# g - repeat until no match (used with "r")
# e - exit (with success) if we match this pattern, do not process
#     subsequent rules
# s - start over from the first rule if we match this pattern
# a - abort (refuse the request) if we match this rule
# G - this rule applies to TFTP GET requests only
# P - this rule applies to TFTP PUT requests only
#
# The regex is a regular expression in the style of egrep(1).
#
# The remapping is a pattern, all characters are verbatim except \
# \0 copies the full string that matched the regex
# \1..\9 copies the 9 first (..) expressions in the regex
# \\ is an escaped \
# See http://linux.die.net/man/8/tftpd for more info.
#
# "#" begins a comment, unless \-escaped
#
